                        <p>Gustav Klimt came from an artistic but impoverished family. His father, a Czech immigrant, was a goldsmith and engraver. But he had no luck with business, and seven of his children grew up in terrible poverty. At the age of 14, Gustav left school to study at the Vienna School of Crafts, where his talent was soon recognized. Together with his brother Ernest and another student Matsch, he founded an artists' association. In the late 1980s, the group gained more and more recognition, including the decoration of the new municipal theatre (1886 – 1888) and the Kunsthistorisches Museum (1890 – 1891). It seemed that Klimt would soon become a pillar of Vienna’s artistic landscape.</p>

                <div class="bio-two">
                    <p>However, the early death of his brother Ernest in 1892 touched him greatly, which coincided with the growing interest in avant-garde movements, with Impressionism and Symbolism at the forefront. In 1897, Klimt became increasingly disillusioned with the conservativeness of the Austrian art scene and, together with a group of friends, decided to give up membership in the Association of Painters and found a new association to promote modern art. The young artists followed in the footsteps of other rebels who formulated the so-called Secessions in different cities.</p>

                    <p>Klimt’s change became clear when he realized another major commission for the mural series for the University of Vienna. Some professors panicked when they saw Klimt’s work and accused him of creating chaotic and pornographic art. The scandal was inflated by the press and 1905. Klimt had to give up work on the paintings, which were destroyed by fire in 1945.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The loss of public contracts did not hinder Klimt’s career, who soon became a celebrated portrait painter. Klimt created stunning pictures of beautiful women, and the orders were delivered by wealthy industrialists. Some of these portraits were more conventional, while others saw the model’s face and hands almost immersed in the rolls of rich ornaments. Klimt’s model for these daring artistic experiments was his sister-in-law Emilie Floge. She ran a women’s clothing store and was the artist’s closest confidant for over 20 years.</p>

                <div class="bio-end">
                    <p>Klimt continued to create murals. In 1902 he led <i>Beethoven’s Fries</i>, as a decorative element of the seat of the Art Nouveau style. In 1904 he received one of his most important commissions – the creation of decorations in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. The strikingly beautiful building was designed by Josef Hoffmann, a co-founder of Viennese Art Nouveau, while Klime was asked to create friezes for the dining room. Three elaborate mosaics made of precious stones, coral and mother-of-pearl will prove to be one of the most beautiful designs. The frieze was completed in 1911.</p>
