                        <p>Four hundred years later, the work of the painter Arcimboldo became a source of inspiration for Surrealists. Born in Italy, he spent his life in Prague, where he was invited to the court of Ferdinand I and became his favourite artist. In his painting, he used natural forms such as fruits and vegetables, from which he created complex compositions that usually represent human forms that are as fascinating as they are entertaining.</p>

                    <p>Giuseppe Arcimboldo was born into an aristocratic but not very wealthy family in Milan (Northern Italy). Not much is known about his first years of life, but it seems that he also learned painting from his father. In 1551, he was employed as a painter for decorative scenes in public buildings such as the Cathedral of Milan. There he painted the front of the building and designed the decoration of the main door and the stained glass windows depicting the life of St. Catherine. Around 1560, Arcin Bordeaux visited the court of the Holy Roman Empire, which encompassed much of Europe, including present-day Germany and Austria, which was under the rule of the German Emperor. his manor moved from one metropolis to two but mainly resided in Vienna and Prague. Arcimboldo received a fixed salary that ensured a prosperous life. Sometimes he was asked to create a simple portrait of the emperor, but from 1563 he was considered a head painter. During this time he created fantastic compositions depicting heads from fruits. Emperor Maximilian II ordered from him portraits of many court officials, which were made in such a convention. The artist remained faithful to this style throughout his life, so he also dealt with the painting of human figures, landscapes and objects.</p>

                    <p>Arcimbold’s works were highly valued at the court, so that after Maximilian’s death in 1570 his successor Rudolf II became the patron. This exceptionally eccentric ruler, who was passionate about art and science, became one of the most important collectors of his time. He lived in complete seclusion in the Prague Palace and was suspected of witchcraft. His interest in the occult may explain the fascination for Arcimbold’s strange compositions that made him famous. As a court painter, he played an essential role in the extravagant life of the imperial court. He was responsible for various festivals – balls, processions and garden parties – which gave him the opportunity to live out his imagination. He also advised the emperor on the purchase of the painting – for this purpose he travelled all over Europe and created one of the most extraordinary collections.</p>

                    <p>This man of many talents also worked as a stage designer, architect and engineer. He designed and constructed waterworks. He also liked music; He created a kind of musical composition in which he sorted the notes by color and his works were performed at the court. By 1587, Arcimboldo had amassed a considerable fortune. He then returned to Italy, where he died a few years later. Outside the courtly milieu, his refined and slightly gloomy works found no recognition.</p>

                <div class="bio-end">
                    <p>Arcimbold’s work was perceived to be morbid, even decadent, and reflected a complex, self-centered court culture in which the play of appearances and theatrical effects was valued above moral issues. Only the 20th century, which attaches great importance to the subconscious and dream visions, brought back his art-historical work. His paintings are among the most sought after today, and many forgeries have appeared on the art market.</p>
