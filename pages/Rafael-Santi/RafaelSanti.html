                        <p>Raphael’s work illustrates the transition from the early to the mature Renaissance. No other artist has contributed so much to the design of the style taught at art academies from the 16th to the 19th century. Rafael was fortunate to spend his early years in the sophisticated atmosphere of the courtyard of Urbino, an Italian city that was an important intellectual and artistic centre. The ruler of Urbino, Prince Federico de Montefeltro, used the buoys he had collected during the victorious campaigns to build one of Italy’s most beautiful cities and attract artists and scientists. </p>

                <div class="bio-two">
                    <p>Rafael’s father died when his son was 11 years old. He was a small but respected painter at court. In the sixties of the 15th century Piero della Francesca was also employed at the court of the Duke, who became famous for his ordered, harmonic compositions. At that time, it was the rule that young artists perfected their workshop by copying the style of the masters, who taught them about all aspects of artistic activity. Rafael’s early works resemble the style of Pietro Perugin, so it is believed that he was the young Raphael’s teacher. The fact, however, was not fully confirmed, and Raphael throughout his life demonstrated an astonishing ability to adopt the characteristic stylistic features of other artists.</p>

                    <p>1504 Rafael traveled to Florence with a letter of recommendation from Duchess Urbino. The young painter has chosen the perfect moment. At that time, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo created works in Florence that solved many of the artistic problems of their predecessors. By adopting the solutions of the masters, Rafael established the reputation of the main promoter of the monumental, figurative style through the style of the mature Renaissance. In 1508, Pope Julius II summoned Raphael to Rome.</p>

                    <p>The Athens School is one of the frescoes that Raphael created to decorate the chambers of the papal seat in the Vatican. The fresco is a tribute to classical philosophy. On the painting only a few persons can be identified, but we know that there is a philosophical debate about the central figures of Plato (which points upwards, into the sphere of pure ideas) and Aristotle (which points down to the sphere of human experience).</p>

                <div class="bio-end">
                    <p>Rafael was highly regarded in the intellectual circles of Rome, and his works were popular with influential patrons of art. For this reason, he had to place most of the orders to a growing number of students. In addition to commissions for altarpieces and portraits, he was also appointed chief architect of St. Peter’s Basilica and prefect of the Roman churches. Although it has often been claimed that Rafael’s untimely death was due to excessive duties, it is more likely that the artist died of a fever.</p>
