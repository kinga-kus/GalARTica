                        <p>One of the most famous artists, his painting – mysterious, reminiscent of dreams and precise in detail – instantly recognizable. His name became synonymous with Surrealism, although most famous paintings were not made until after 1936, after the artist was removed from the movement. Salvador Dali, son of a respected notary, was born in Figueras, Catalonia, a Spanish province known for its rich culture and independence. The prodigal son very quickly internalized a variety of avant-garde styles. At the age of 17 he was praised by Catalan critics as a great talent. He was admitted to the San Fernando Academy in Madrid, where he studied for four years, but became involved in student struggles and was expelled. Since then, he has devoted himself entirely to the deepening of his dreams, obsessions and the cultivation of eccentricity.</p>

                <div class="bio-two">
                    <p>He was also influenced by Ernest Meissonnier, a French exponent of 19th-century historical painting, who, together with Jan Vermeer and Jaean-Francois Millet, became the focus of Dalí’s interest. Dali became one of the Surrealists, a member of a group of artists fascinated by everything irrational and absurd. A group of poets, painters such as Yves Tanguy and filmmaker Luis Bunuel tried to combine dream visions with reality, to create an “absolute reality” or a “supreality. ” 1927 Dali began to paint pictures that reflected this search.</p>

                <div class="bio-three">
                    <p>1928 Dali worked with Luis Bunuel on the shocking film Andalusian Dog (1929) with the famous opening showing the cut of the eye. The plot follows the delirious logic of a dream, Dalí’s obsession with decay and his interest in the subconscious, rape and sexuality. With Bunuel he also made the film The Golden Age (1930); Later he shot a dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock’s Fesseln (1945). The great psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, whose theories of the subconscious and impulses revolutionized many areas of art and culture, shaped Dalí’s work. The artist invented a pseudo-scientific “paranoic-critical” method that referred to his conscious (or critical) manipulation of reality. Dalí’s paintings often depict landscapes of dreams, a world of illusions and fantasies, in which objects enter into strange relationships and penetrate each other. His work contains such incredible, hallucinatory images as a human figure from open drawers and a giant molten clock.</p>

                    <p>1929 Dali fell in love with Gali, the wife of the surreal poet Paul Eluard; The gala became his life partner and source of inspiration. Surrealists, who were amazed by his painting and fascinated by his scandalizing behaviour, welcomed the artist with open hands, but supported him in the mid-1930s by General Francisco Franco. They aroused their concern and led to Dali being expelled from the group. In 1942 Dali and Gala emigrated to the United States. By combining masterful self-promotion, talent and personality strength, Dali became immensely wealthy. In 1942 he published his autobiography My Secret Life and in 1944 his first novel Verborgene Gesichter. Many later works (such as Christ since St. John on the Cross, 1951) attest to the fascination of the paintings of old masters for the imagination of the Christian world and the processes of perception of the work. He also painted portraits of Gali and experimented with other artistic fields such as jewellery and theatre decorations.</p>

                    <p>1955. Dali has returned to Spain. Andre Breton christened it with the unfriendly anagram of his name Avida Dollars. Until the end of the eccentric and subversive, Dali died as one of the most famous and controversial artists of the twentieth century.</p>
