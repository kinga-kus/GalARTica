                        <p>Although Leonardo da Vinci completed only a few paintings, his works, along with those of Raphael and Michelangelo, are considered to be the quintessence of the art of the mature Renaissance, a period of extraordinary flowering of art and philosophy. Leonardo was already regarded by his contemporaries as an extraordinary person, not only for his artistic work, but also for his achievements in the fields of engineering and music.</p>

                <div class="bio-two">
                    <p>Leonardo spent his childhood in a simple country house of his mother. He then moved to Florence, where he studied with the artist Anrdei del Verrocchia. The Verrocchia workshop was one of the largest and busiest workshops in Florence, while Leonardo remained in contact with the master until 1476. At that time, Florence was the avant-garde centre of Italy, so it is unclear why Leonardo went to the court of Ludovic Sforza, Duke of Milan, in 1482. The Duke’s patronage, however, allowed the artist to freely develop individual preferences far beyond the limits normally applied to artists. Leonardo was fascinated by the mystery of the divine power that united and harmonized the elements of nature.</p>

                <div class="bio-three">
                    <p>He had a comprehensive knowledge of traditional and modern scientific theories. He carried out systematic experiments and observations. The artist recorded his thoughts in notebooks containing hundreds of sketches and texts written in green, explored human anatomy to find out how the body works in motion, and took an interest in flying. The scientific analysis of the principles of the movement of flowing water and cloud systems was accompanied by studies of the curly hair folds of plant draping and even of the interrelationships between the groupings of the figures.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Leonardo did more than anyone else to prove that artistic activities are an intellectual profession and not a manual one. That is why he tries to apply the conclusions of his extensive scientific research to every element of the image, without adhering to conventional styles or techniques. For this reason, he has had a reputation for failing to meet the deadlines laid down in the Treaties for most of his time. He often didn’t finish the pictures. Among Leonardo’s most famous works are the Last Supper (ca. 1496-1498), painted on the wall of the Church of Santa Maria Della Grazie in Milan, and two versions of the Madonna under the rocks (ca. 1483 and ca. 1506). These paintings seem to tell from a human perspective what constitutes a new precedent for painting.</p>

                <div class="bio-end">
                    <p>Between 1503 and 1506, Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa, a portrait of an unknown woman who was often identified with Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant. The enigmatic ambiguity of the model’s smile fascinated the audience and made it the most famous image in European art history. In 1499, Leonardo had to leave the court of the Sforza. His last years were less quiet, on his constant journeys between Florence, Milan and Rome. Leonardo ended his life in Amboise as the guest of honour of the French King Francis I. Leonardo da Vinci’s work is considered the culmination of a mature Renaissance. But Leonardo always appeared as a predicted individuality, more than a magician than an artist of the isolated world of his innovative ideas.</p>
